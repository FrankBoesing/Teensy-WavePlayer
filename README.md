# Teensy-WavePlayer

This is an extended file player audio object, combining the functions of AudioPlaySdWav and AudioPlaySdRaw
with additional stability and functionality.

## Features

- Sample rate agnostic (does not check it)
- (up to) 8 Channels / 8- or 16-bit
- delay() after start no longer needed
- all audio block sizes
- interleaved reads / writes: only one file access on each audio-cycle
- lastErr() returns last error
- synchronized start
- recording (still work in progress - not documented - may not work sometimes)

## Play: Formats
- n channel 8 bit unsigned *.wav
- n channel u-law *.wav
- n channel 16 bit signed *.wav
- n channel 24 bit signed *.wav
- n channel 8 bit signed *.aiff
- n channel 8 bit unsigned *.aifc
- n channel u-law *.aifc (Apple, non ccitt)
- n channel 16 bit signed *.aiff
- n channel 8 bit signed, unsigned or u-law RAW
- n channel 16 bit signed, unsigned or 16 bit big-endian signed RAW

## Record: Formats
- n channel 8 bit unsigned *.wav
- n channel 16 bit signed *.wav

## Updated GUI

An updated `index.html` file is supplied which documents the key API calls provided by AudioPlayWav. The object placed on the design area shows 8 outputs, of which 1, 2, 4, 6 or 8 will output audio data, depending on the number of channels provided in the file [can a RAW file have 3, 5 or 7 channels?]

## Main functions
#### play(File | filename [,paused])
Plays the `File` object or named file; setting the optional `paused` parameter to `true` allocates and pre-loads the buffer, but does not start playing. Buffer memory is allocated when this function is called, with the amount dependent on the number of audio channels provided in the file.
#### bool pause(bool)
Starts a paused object if the parameter is `true`, or pauses it if `false`. Returns new state.
#### stop()
Stops playing, whether or not it is paused. The file is closed and buffer memory returned to the heap.
#### isPlaying()
Return true (non-zero) if playing, or false (zero) when stopped or paused.  
#### isStopped()
Return true (non-zero) if stopped, or false (zero) when playing or paused.  
#### isPaused()
Return true (non-zero) if paused, or false (zero) when playing or stopped.  
#### positionMillis()
While playing, return the current time offset, in milliseconds.  When not playing, the return from this function is undefined.
#### lengthMillis()
Return the total length of the current sound clip,in milliseconds. When not playing, the return from this function is undefined.
#### lasterr()
If an internal error occurs, for example during a call to `play()` or within the audio update loop interrupt, this function will return the most recent error code. Possible values are:
- 0: no error
- 1: file format unsupported
- 2: file unredable (may not exist?)
- 3: insufficient memory to allocate buffer etc.
- 4: insufficient available audio blocks

## Detailed description
For the purposes of this documentation, it is assumed that the audio engine is compiled without changing the default audio block size (128 samples) or sample rate (44.1kHz), resulting in an update cycle of approximately 2.9ms. However, the AudioPlayWav object is intended to work with other block sizes and samples rates - please raise an issue if you find a combination that doesn't work, and you think that it should...
### Interleaved reads
By careful choice of buffer sizes and pre-load amount, the AudioPlayWav objects attempt to ensure that only one SD card read is attempted on each audio engine update. The buffer size required in order to do this is proportional to the total number of AudioPlayWav objects, the number of channels the WAV file contains, the sample size, and the audio block size. So for 3x 4-channel 16-bit files, 3 buffers of 4 x 2 x 128 bytes are needed, for a total allocation of 3kBytes of RAM. The SD card reads will occur every 2.9ms, and read in 1kByte of data.

### Synchronising playback start
In order to play multiple files in exact synchronisation, it is preferable to proceed as follows:
- call `play(<file>,true)` for all files, to pre-load their buffers without outputting any sound
- call `AudioNoInterrupts()` to prevent the audio interrupt firing
- call `pause(false)` for all the objects
- call `AudioInterrupts()` to allow the audio interrupt to fire: playback will start at the next interrupt

# Recording
Some hints first:
- You can record to any file that is supported by Teensyduino - i.e. littlFS etc.
- IF you want to record to SD, keep this in mind:
  - The SD Card needs time to update the FAT and to do internal operations like wear levelling. When this will happen is unpredictable. Use a good, fast card. Unfortunately, when you buy a card, no label or logo on the card tells you if it is good for microcontrollers. Id had success with a Kingston GO! Plus 64GB.
Here is a test of various cards: https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/68418-Which-SD-is-Best-for-Audio-Projects?p=290795&viewfull=1#post290795
  - Important, increase the AUDIO_BLOCK_SAMPLES to 256 or 512.
  - In some cases it might be better to record to littlFS in PSRAM, and to copy the recorded file to SD later.
  - I recommend not to record more than one file at a time. Better is to use one file with more channels, if required.
  - Don't use SPI. Use a Teensy 4.1 and the inbuilt SD slot.
 

## Main functions
#### record(File | filename, format, numChannels, [,paused])
Plays the `File` object or named file; setting the optional `paused` parameter to `true` allocates and pre-loads the buffer and pre-allocates the file, but does not start recording. Buffer memory is allocated when this function is called, with the amount dependent on the number of audio channels.
NumChannels is the number of recorded channels (i.e. 1 for mono, 2 for stereo etc).
Currently, two formats are supported: `APW_8BIT_UNSIGNED` and `APW_16BIT_SIGNED`

Examples: 
- `record('test.wav', APW_16BIT_SIGNED, 2)` starts recording a 16Bit stereo file to SD.
- `record('test.wav', APW_8BIT_UNSIGNED, 1, paused)` prepares (preallocates file, write dummy wave-header, etc)  the recording of a 8Bit mono file. 

#### bool pause(bool)
Like above for playing. The wave-file header is written.
#### stop()
Like above for playing. The wave-file header is written.
#### isRecording().
Return true (non-zero) if recording, or false (zero) when stopped or paused.  
#### isStopped()
like above for playing
#### isPaused()
like above for playing
#### lengthMillis()
Return the total length of the current sound clip,in milliseconds. When not playing, the return from this function is undefined.
#### lasterr()
Like above for playing
